**Learning:** Multiple individual Zustand selectors in React components/hooks (e.g. `const score = useGameStore(s => s.score); const theme = useGameStore(s => s.theme);`) create multiple subscriptions to the store.
**Action:** Group related selectors into a single object and wrap them with `useShallow` (e.g. `const { score, theme } = useGameStore(useShallow(s => ({ score: s.score, theme: s.theme })))`) to reduce store subscriptions and unnecessary re-renders.

**Learning:** Multiple individual Zustand selectors in React components/hooks (e.g. `const score = useGameStore(s => s.score); const theme = useGameStore(s => s.theme);`) create multiple subscriptions to the store, which can cause performance issues due to excessive re-rendering and subscription overhead. This is a common performance anti-pattern.
